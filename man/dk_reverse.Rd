\title{Calculate amount of radioactivity given interval.}
\usage{
dk_reverse(t, half_life, A1)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Time past since activity of interest. Units are arbitrary, but must
match half-life.}

\item{half_life}{Half-life. Units are arbitrary, but must match time past.}

\item{A1}{The target activity or related parameter, such as dose rate.}
}
\value{
The original activity or related parameter.
}
\description{
Calculate the activity at an earlier time, given the time past,
  the half-life, and the activity at time, t. The result will provide
  activity in the same units as provided for present activity. Time past and
  half-life must be in consistent units.

\examples{
dk_reverse(80, 8, 1)
