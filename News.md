radsafer (version 1.0.0)
========================

Big news! **radsafer** is now available from CRAN! So, we should be announcing the grand opening, right?

But wait. **RadData** (<https://github.com/markhogue/RadData>) has also just been issued by CRAN. So, this is the soft opening for just a few close friends because a much more compelling version of **radsafer** will be out soon. It is going to have some really helpful functions for accessing, screening, plotting, and making inputs from **RadData**.

Here's the backstory of **radsafer** and **RadData**. Here at radsafer world headquarters, we were all excited when we figured out what we could do with access to the ICRP 107 Nuclear Decay Data for Dosimetric Calculations. So excited, we wanted to share it, along with a bunch of other generally helpful health physics functions. But then, we found we couldn't meet CRAN's size limit of 5 MB with all that data. Then, we had other issues to deal with and were not sure if **RadData** would ever get off the ground. So, we pursued, in parallel, issuing a lighter **radsafer** and **RadData**. And now, suddenly, success has arrived at the same time on both projects! We're so psyched!

So, stay tuned, friends. **radsafer** will be out with version 1.1.0 probably around early May 2019. Then we'll announce it to all the world.
