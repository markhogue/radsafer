# radsafer (version 1.0.0)

***2019-04-06***

Big news\! **radsafer** is now available from CRAN\! So, we should be
announcing the grand opening, right?

But wait. **RadData** (<https://github.com/markhogue/RadData>) has also
just been issued by CRAN. So, this is the soft opening for just a few
close friends because a much more compelling version of **radsafer**
will be out soon. It is going to have some really helpful functions for
accessing, screening, plotting, and making inputs from **RadData**.

Here’s the backstory of **radsafer** and **RadData**. Here at radsafer
world headquarters, we were all excited when we figured out what we
could do with access to the ICRP 107 Nuclear Decay Data for Dosimetric
Calculations. So excited, we wanted to share it, along with a bunch of
other generally helpful health physics functions. But then, we found we
couldn’t meet CRAN’s size limit of 5 MB with all that data. Then, we had
other issues to deal with and were not sure if **RadData** would ever
get off the ground. So, we pursued, in parallel, issuing a lighter
**radsafer** and **RadData**. And now, suddenly, success has arrived at
the same time on both projects\! We’re so psyched\!

So, stay tuned, friends. **radsafer** will be out with version 1.1.0
probably around early May 2019. Then we’ll announce it to all the world.

***2019-04-21*** New functions have been added to the development
version, 1.0.0.9000. Several of the existing functions have had slight
changes, including name changes that will help make the package easier
to use going forward.
